## What is a binary search algorithm?

&nbsp; A binary search algorithm is an algorithm that makes searching faster. It takes an array of elements (array must be sorted) and traverses through it to find an element.

&nbsp; For example, imagine you want to find a contact from your contacts book. First you will need to know the name of the person, then you skip the n-number of pages in order to not go through them so that it makes searching much faster.

&nbsp;

## **Big O of binary search**

```
For the worst case scenario it takes n-steps to find en element ⇒ O(n)
For the best case scenario if will be a log function ⇒ O(logN)
```
