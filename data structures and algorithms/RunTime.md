# Running Time and Big O

### What is run timing in software development?

- Running time - is a measurement of how fast the algorithm is executed during its run time

```
Example: The time of the function execution depends on the rise of the input parameters (which is called a linear time)
```

### Big O notation

- Big O notation is widely used in discrete mathematics, and is a special notation that tells how fast the algorithm is.

```
Example:
  1. Binary search has a logarithmic run time ==> O(logN)
  2. Linear search ==> O(n)
```

The number of input elements is very important when it comes to choosing what type of timing to uses

&nbsp;

> Basically, Big O is helping us to know how many operations the particular algorithm will take
>
> It tells us how fast the algorithm grows

_*Big O notation is about the worst case scenario*_

### A list of common Big O scenarios (from fastest to slowest)

1. O(logN) => log time
2. O(n) => linear time
3. O(n \* logN)
4. O(n^2) => squared run time
5. O(n!) => factorial run time
